- Download the archived folder (.zip file) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Unlike previous labs, there is no template for you to modify. Instead, create a Jupyter Notebook named dsc305_lab04_lastname_firstname.ipynb (with your last and first name)
- Include a header cell with the level-one heading "Lab 4: Dry Beans Classification".
- As for past lab assignments, also include a bulleted list with your name, name of your lab partner, course designation and semester (DSC 305A S23), and name of the assignment.
- Import the Excel worksheet. (Hint: Pandas has a read_excel() method analogous to read_csv(). Use the help feature to learn how to use it.)
- Your objective for this lab: Develop a model that accurately predicts the type of dry bean (the Class label, e.g., SEKER, BOMBAY, etc.) given the values of the other features.
- As usual, you should perform a thorough exploratory data analysis, resolve any issues involving data that are missing or otherwise problematic, and partition the data into training and test sets.
- For this lab you should explore a wide range of models, including extensive hyperparameter tuning. You are encouraged to use the sklearn's grid search cross validation and pipeline tools for this assignment. Note that grid search may require a long time to run. Experiment with fewer models to make sure everything is running and then allow adequate time for your program to run. Do not wait until the last minute on this assignment.
- You should work on the analytics project, including the code, together with your lab partner. (Teams that do not work together effectively will receive a reduced score.)
- Individually, annotate your notebook to describe the dataset, your exploration of it, significant steps that you took in the analytic process, and your analysis. Include a conclusion, acknowledgements, references. In assigning a grade on the assignment, I will take into consideration the quality of your writing and data visualization as well as that of your analytic work.
- Submit your notebook along with the data file here to Moodle as usual.
